Unit Testing is a method thar is used to validate if units of code are operating as designed. A unit
is a smaller testable part of an application. 
We first test the unit in our local system, we validate that the unit works well and make sure it is 
not failing. Move the unit into a server environment and test it again and make sure it is still not 
failing and works fine and fix any errors encountered. Once the code passes these stages, it will be
moved to the final code base.

There is a python module unittest which can be used to test functions and units of applications.
