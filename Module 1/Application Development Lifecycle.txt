There are seven different stages of the application development lifecycle; requirement gathering,
analysis, design, code and test, user and system testing, production and maintenance.

In the requirement gathering phase, we will gather all the requirements across the application,
these include; user requirements, business requirements and technical requirements.
We must also capture any constraints of the design and viability of the business model.

After gathering all the requirements are gathered, we must analyse a possible solution we could 
incoorporate.During the analysis and design of the code there may be multiple renditions of the
solutions and verifications to make a solution that meets all the requirements and constraints.
The documentation here should be detailed, clear and concise.

In the code and testing stage, we first code the application according to the document specificaiton
and then tested and revised until the code meets all the requirements. The testing performed for the
unit code is called unit testing, we conduct unit testing at the programming level.
User testing tests and verifies the functionality from the user's point of view, there also needs
to be several system level testing including perfomance and integration testing.

After testing, the application can be sent to production where the end user can use the application.
In the production phase, the application msut remain in a steady state, when this is not possible,
changes must be tested thouroughly before being put into production.
In maintenance when new features or upgrades are added, all the stages are went tthrough before this
feature is completely added to the application.

Functionality should be split accross multiple files to allow for cleaner code that is easier to
maintain and this helps when new functionality is being added.
