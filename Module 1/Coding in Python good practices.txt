We need to ensure that the python code written is readable, concise and meets some 
standards and conventions.

We need to use indentation to make sure the code is properly nested and 
someone can follow the code along to see how it works. Make sure to use
spaces for indentation to make sure it is consistent alond different editors.

Blank lines should be used to separate functions and other code to make it much more
readable.

Using spaces around operaters and commas helps readability and makes commands look
spacious and discrete.

Create separate fucntions for different functionality, these functions can then be 
called in the main program or code. This also reduces the need to write multiple 
lines of the same code and saves time for development, this increases the
performance of the code aswell.

Naming of the files, funcitons and variables should make sense and relate to their 
funciton in the programm and application allowing any other person to traverse through 
the code much easier.

Static analysis is the method of comparing the written code against a standard to check
compliance and evaluate the code without having to run it. Ususally found issues include,
programming logical or syntax errors, standard violations and undefined variables.
