A web application is a program stored on a remote server that is delivered on the internet.
A web app requires 3 components to process a client's request; a web server, an app server 
and a database. We code the front-end using HTML, JS and CSS and the back-end in Java, Ruby
and Python. Some advantages of using a web app instead of a locally hosted app is that;
the version is the same for each user, the user can use whichever device they want
and users do not need to install the application locally.

An API iis a software that allows 2 applications that are not related to help create more
flexibility for programmers and allow them to request data from other apps. APIs have standardised 
rules and functions as to how they should behave about data within an app.

REST(Representation State Transfer) or SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol) are two API software
architectures
