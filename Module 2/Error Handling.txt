Every HTTP reponse contains a 3 digit code that tells us the status,
this could be an error or a success. The client is reponsible for 
consuming the error code.

Error codes from 100-199 signify that a request has been recieved 
and are informational.
Error codes from 200-299 signify that request has been recieved
and that the operation was successful.
Error codes from 300-399 indicate a redirection in the server.
Error codes in the 400-499 show thaat an error has taken place 
within the actual request.
Error codes from 500-599 say that an error has taken place on the
server side.

Your code can return a different status code following these
conventions, it allows you to send the status code in a tuple
along with the response. You can also use the make_response()
method to explicitly set the status code.

Some status codes.
