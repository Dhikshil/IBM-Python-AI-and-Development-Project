Flask is a micro-framewok that can be used to create web applications. It is not opinionated nor bind
the user to some specific set of tools.  Flask provides minimal dependencies to creating a web app
but is extensible and provides many community-based extensions and features.

Main features include; built in web server that runs apps in developer mode, debugging tools with traceback
and standard Python logging, built in unit testing and enables access to request and response objects.

Static files are supported by flask and provides tags to these static files to load them in templates,
dynamic pages can be developed can display information that may change. Flask provides routing and
supports dynamic URLs and are useful for RESTful services.

Django is another developing framwork.
Flask is lightweight and only provides the basic dependencies needed but is extensible, quite flexible 
allowing the developer to control everything. 
Django is a full-stack framework and includes everything needed for a full-stack application, it is
opinionated and makes most of the decisions so the developer can focus on the application's logic.
