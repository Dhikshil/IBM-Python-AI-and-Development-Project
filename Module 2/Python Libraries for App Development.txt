Python libraries are like toolkits with speicalised functionality for certain programming tasks; numPy
is used for mathematical operations and Pandas is used for data manipulation and finally Matplotlib 
simplifies data visualisation. This saves development time for developers.

Frameworks are predefined structures for app development, they provide guidelines and facilitate good
coding practices by making it easy to use them and organising code to enable reusing code of libraries
for adding features. Using a framework eases the developing process with the pre-defined libraries and
modules and debugging and testing tools. This allows them to add mroe functionality with less code.
